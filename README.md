A trading strategy is a set of rules to follow for desicions regarding buying and selling in markets. Strategies can range from involving a couple of relatively simple indicators to a plethora of intricate mathamatics. Some strategies involve parameters whose values greatly impact trading decision in the market. This project uses evolutionary algorithms (a type of deep learning) to optimize a trading strategy's parameters to maximize returns.
